# Surfs_Up Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 
The main purpose of the analysis is to find out the temperature data for months of June and December.Hence to make a decision opening up the surf shop and to see if it is going to be sustainable all year around. 12 months pf precipitation, the most active stations, temperature analysis of the most active station, station with the highest temperature have been analysed prior to this analysis. Those information can be found in the following link.

The analysis specifically for this analysis which are temperature data for the months of June and December can be found in the following link.

## Results

- Average temperature for the month of June is higher than the month of December even though the count is higher in June 
- As the std is higher for the month of December it can be said the variance of the same also higher and that indicates how far the set of data of temperature is from the         average. As the month of June has lower std than the month of December, the data of temperature fairly close to the average.
- Percentiles of the month of June is higher than the month of December as well. Hence the higher temperature falls between 25% - 75% in June. 

## Summary
- As per the previous and current analysis it is Noticeable that the temperature and the precipitation for the month of June , December and other months are very good. 
- However there are other parameters and factors that can be used before making the decesion. 
- SWOT analysis following by the data analysis is key factor.
- Find out more information about number of tourists , hotels around the stations can be important. 
- Completeing analysis of few other islands other than Oahu will be benefited comparing the weather data.  

### Two additional queries can be done to gather more weather for June and December 
- According the previous analysis we only analysed the last 12 months of precipitation data. We should analyse the number of years that we analysed the temperature for the both minths 
- Query to gather data for humidity
