# surfs_up Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 
The main purpose of the analysis is to find out the temperature data for months of June and December.Hence to make a decision opening up the surf shop and to see if it is going to be sustainable all year around. 12 months pf precipitation, the most active stations, temperature analysis of the most active station, station with the highest temperature have been analysed prior to this analysis. Those information can be found in the following link.

The analysis specifically for this analysis which are temperature data for the months of June and December can be found in the following link.

- Average temperature for the month of June is higher than the month of December even though the count is higher in June 
- As the std is higher for the month of December it can be said the variance of the same also higher and that indicates how far the set of data of temperature is from the         average. As the month of June has lower std than the month of December, the data of temperature fairly close to the average.
- Percentiles of the month of June is higher than the month of December as well. Hence the higher temperature falls between 25% - 75% in June. 

Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
